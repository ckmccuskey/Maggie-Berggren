  <h2>About</h2>

  <p>I will be graduating in December 2019 with a BIS in Communication Studies, Technical Writing and Communication, and Outdoor Recreation and Education. Although I have many ideas and plans for after graduation, I have absolutely no sense of direction as to where I will end up.
  </p>
  <p>My current job is with a non-profit in the outdoor adventure and education field which focuses on inclusion of all people, no matter physical ability, financial means, or location.  I work in the office as Development Assistant, helping to make everything possible from behind-the-scenes.
  </p>
  <p>When not working or studying, I can bury myself in a book for hours on end.  I love figure skating, biking, hiking, exploring with my camera, and going to concerts with friends.
